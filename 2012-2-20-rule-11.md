## Rule 11
- lawyer certifies:
	- proper purpose
	- legal support
	- factual support
- applies to most papers filed in litigation outside of discovery
	- 11(d): does not apply to disclosures in discovery etc.
- Twombly and Iqbal have somewhat raised the toll on the road to discovery

### Pre 1983
- p. 113 of G+V
- rarely used
	- only 11 times

### 1983 - 1993
- sanctions were mandatory
	- emphasis on monetary sanctions (ex. reas. expenses as a result of the filing)

### 1993 Amendments
- mandatory sanctions overly chilled filings on new legal theories or cases with facts yet to be discovered
- lead to a lot of collateral litigation around just Rule 11
- Someone can file a Rule 11 on a Rule 11 motion

### Reformed Rule 11

### Barbie case
- Mattel sued CDC (USC/Claudene Doll creator)
	- case settled
	- D counterclaims
- It was logically impossible for Mattel to have copied the Claudene doll
- Mattel serves Hicks with the Rule 11 motion
	- under current rule 11, what could Hicks have done to avoid sanctions?
		- pull back claim within 21 days (Safe Harbor Provision)
			- added to Rule 11 to encourage out of court solutions
	- Hicks violated 11(b)(3) and 11(b)(2)
		- 11(b)(3) - failure to an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances
		- 11(b)(2)
- court throws kitchen sink at Hicks, kinda overusing their authority
	- sanctions him for boorish behavior at deposition
		- Rule 11 doesn't sanction boorish behavior
	- lying about browsing the magazine
		- potentially covered by Rule 11 because he certified the factual and legal basis of something that was false
			- the actual paper being Rule 11'd is the Complaint
				- however, Hicks never lied about anything in the Complaint
- District court imposed $500,000 sanctions on Hicks
	- monetary sanction must be deterrent 11(c)(4)
		- raises question of does $$$ go to other party or to the court
			- if both parties are competitors, then $$$ to your competitor is a worse deterrent
			- if goal was to financially bully one side, giving them the money is a deterrent
	- notice that court sanctions Hicks, not his client => Rule 11(c)(1)
		- sanctions can be made against any attorney or party responsible for the violation
	- can a party represented by a lawyer be sanctioned? Yes, if the client misleads the attorney 11(b)(3).
		- "... responsible for the violation"
		- 11(5)(a): no sanctions against represented party for violating 11(b)(2)
		- *RULE: clients cannot be liable for legal insufficiencies, but can be for factual insufficiencies*

### Civil Action
- EPA report
	- Under current Rule 11, does the report give sufficient evidentiary support to defeat a Rule 11?
		- standard: inquiry reasonable under the circumstances...yes.

### Powerlifters case
- Frantz v. US Powerlifting
- 2 lifters sued USP for monopoly when
- Cotter files 12(b)(6) motion because P's motion was wrong on the legal issue (officer can't conspire w his own corp)
	- Follows up with Rule 11 motion
		- 11(b)(2) - orig. complaint was not warranted under existing law or by non-frivolous argument for modifying or existing law
			- court grants this, asks for his bill
				- Cotter says $4k to dismiss complaint, and $40K for the Rule 11
					- District Court was shocked at this

### difference between Rules 8 and 11
- Rule 8 is about what's in the lawyer's head, not what's in the complaint

- Rule 11 will apply when there is no basis, not for close cases
