### Mullane  

Money managers; Publication notice

Holding: statutory notice by publication is adequate only for people whose whereabouts are unknown or whose rights are conjectural. People who have known whereabouts are entitles to receive notice by mail.

Rule: you are entitled to reasonable notice.

Mullane created the "reasonably calculated" standard for notice.

#### Jones v. Flowers

Holding: Mullane requires that when the gov't realizes its method of notice has failed, the gov't must take additional steps.

### Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4

~p. 22

The rules which outlines how process or notice must be served to a person, place, or dwelling (for Federal court). Each state also has its own rule for its state courts.

Serve *complaint and *summons.

Waiver Rule 4 D p. 20
Why would a Defendant waive this?
Stick: Failure to wave => might have to pay extra costs
Carrot: Extra days to answer process

#### Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 4 (not tested)

		- Copy of complaint must be given to sheriff, or someone else, pursuance to (b)
	
	(b) Same: Form
		- must have signature, contact info
	
	(c) By whom served
		- must be served by the proper person, ex sheriff
		
	(d) Summons: Personal service within the commonwealth

### Constitutional Requirements Ritualized: Rule 4

Rule 5(b)(2)(E) - electronic service allowed (Dec. 2001)

Plaintiffs must send paper copies of emailed documents.

### National Development Co. v. Triad Holding Corp & Adnan Khashoggi

Khashoggi claims he can only be served personally, at his compound in Saudi Arabia (Green v. Lindsey defense).

Khashoggi's lawyer files a 60(b)(4) motion (provides relief from judgment that was already made because judgment was "void" [because the service process was not kosher]). Court denied, Khashoggi appeals to 2nd District Court.

Dispute over meaning of "dwelling house or usual place of abode" (Equity Rule 13). Can there be only one of these per person? Or many?

When plain language is inadequate, a court will look at
	- Advisory Committee notes (equivalent of legislative history)
	- Federal Practice and Procedures (treatise by Wright and Miller)
		- "Bible" of civil procedure, cited almost as if it is a source of law
		
Court: we shouldn't make it super, super hard to get cases going.
	- Test: *sufficient indicia of permanence

Has the rule been satisfied?

### Two-step Analysis: Constitutional and Statutory

Constitutional avoidance: Courts don't like to decide constitutional questions unless they have to. So the first question is:

	Was the rule satisfied?
	
Then:

	Even if the statute was complied with, are there still constutitional issues?
