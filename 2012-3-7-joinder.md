## Joinder
- The process by which a case gets more complicated than "P -> D"
- Anytime there's more than one arrow on the chart, there is a joinder rule

### Pros
- efficiencies when Ps get together to make a suit

### Cons
- complicated, unmanageable, prejudice parties who oppose joinder
	- there is a goal of preserving the efficiency

### Factors when allowing
- stage of the case
	- less likely the later the case
- if it can easily be brought somewhere else, judge will say, bring it somewhere else
	- otherwise, judge is inclined to keep it together

### Joinder of Claims
- allows P to file 2 claims instead of 1
- Rule 13

### Joinder of Parties
- When can a P sue 2 defendants?
- Rule 20
- Rule 19 sometimes forces P to sue 2 defendants

### Rule 13

### Rule 14

### Rule 18
- once you get initial claimette in between any parties, you can keep adding claims, even if they are not related
- same parties, not same facts

### Rule 19
- mandatory joinder: you must invite someone to the party

### Rule 20
- permissive joinder of parties
- governs:
	1. When may P voluntarily join together to file a suit together?
	2. When may a P or group of Ps sue more than one D in the case? a(2)
- requirements:
	- common issue of law test

### Rule 21
- Severance, one case proceeds completely on its own, machete chop

### Rule 24
- Intervention: people can invite themselves to the party

### Rule 42(b)
- separate trials
- convenience to expedite

### Questions
1. 
2. Is there subject matter jurisdiction over the "claimette"
	- closely-related claimettes can get a free ride for subject matter jurisdiction (supplemental jurisdiction)
3. Judicial management (Rule 21 and 42(b) invite the judge if she deems appropriate from her perspective to divide it all)

### Grumman
- compulsory or permissive counterclaim?
- same transaction or occurrence test
	- rule 20
- are the essential facts of the original claim so similar that it justifies putting everything int he same lawsuit?

### Crossclaims
- Rule 13(g)

### Mosley v. GM
- p. 962
