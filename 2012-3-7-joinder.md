## Joinder
- The process by which a case gets more complicated than "P -> D"
- Anytime there's more than one arrow on the chart, there is a joinder rule

### Pros
- efficiencies when Ps get together to make a suit

### Cons
- complicated, unmanageable, prejudice parties who oppose joinder
	- there is a goal of preserving the efficiency

### Factors when allowing
- stage of the case
	- less likely the later the case
- if it can easily be brought somewhere else, judge will say, bring it somewhere else
	- otherwise, judge is inclined to keep it together

### Joinder of Claims
- allows P to file 2 claims instead of 1
- Rule 13

### Joinder of Parties
- When can a P sue 2 defendants?
- Rule 20
- Rule 19 sometimes forces P to sue 2 defendants

### Rule 13

### Rule 14
- A defendant can add a 3rd party D to the case when there is *derivative liability*
- derivative liability: no direct liability; but if D is liable to P, then 3PD is liable to D
	- examples: contribution, indemnification, strict products liability (ex. WW VW// ultimately the party responsible for the defect will the one that has to pay)
- policy rationale: judicial economy
	- it's almost certain that the second suit (D suing 3PD) is going to happen
- 1948 amendment: the only kind of third party joinder is from derivative liability
- within 14 days, you don't need permission for D to add 3PD. Rule 14(a)(1).

### Rule 18
- once you get initial claimette in between any parties, you can keep adding claims, even if they are not related
- same parties, not same facts

### Rule 19
- http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_19
- tool of D
- mandatory joinder: you must invite someone to the party
- Three Steps:
	- Is the missing party the one that is required to be joined if feasible? 19(a).
		- is it feasible? It would not be feasible for example if there is an issue with subject matter jurisdiction
			- if yes, order that the party be joined
			- if no, ask under 19(b), whether court can in equity and good conscience proceed without the party?
- sometimes D really wants X in the suit, and knows it is feasible to join them, so it does so. 
	- But sometimes D uses 19 to get the whole case dismissed because the court can't proceed without X.
- D strategy:
	- it would not be feasible for X to be in case because it would destroy diversity j
	- case must be dismissed because X is essential to the case
- three basic theories for determining feasibility of joinder (prejudice)
	- if that party's absence prevents the court from giving complete relief (meant to help the P)
- Examples:
	- Helzberg (p. 968)
		- Helzberg didn't really care about Lords
	- Limited fund case
		- in the interest of not prejudicing X, X must be a D alongside D
	- Prejudice against D
		- if X is not present, D will be liable in multiple similar cases

### Rule 20
- http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_20
- tool of P
- new players on the game board
- voluntary joinder
- regulates what P can do
- permissive joinder of parties
- governs:
	1. When may P voluntarily join together to file a suit together?
	2. When may a P or group of Ps sue more than one D in the case? a(2)
- requirements:
	- common issue of law test

#### 19 and 20: 4 categories
1. Parties that can't be joined to the case even if P wants them in the case
2. Parties that P may voluntarily join to the complaint, pursuant to Rule 20
3. 19(a) parties: parties that must be joined if it is feasible to join them
4. Parties deemed to be indispensable--court cannot go on without them in good conscience

### Rule 21
- Severance, one case proceeds completely on its own, machete chop

### Rule 24
- Intervention: people can invite themselves to the party
- mechanism: person who wants to intervene motions to intervene, then sets forth requisite claims or defenses

### Rule 42(b)
- separate trials
- convenience to expedite

### Questions
1. 
2. Is there subject matter jurisdiction over the "claimette"
	- closely-related claimettes can get a free ride for subject matter jurisdiction (supplemental jurisdiction)
3. Judicial management (Rule 21 and 42(b) invite the judge if she deems appropriate from her perspective to divide it all)

### Grumman
- compulsory or permissive counterclaim?
- same transaction or occurrence test
	- rule 20
- are the essential facts of the original claim so similar that it justifies putting everything int he same lawsuit?

### Crossclaims
- Rule 13(g)

### Mosley v. GM
- p. 962
- called into question by Wal Mart v. Dukes
	- women around the country sued Wal-Mart for gender discrimination
		- under Rule 23 (class action rule),
