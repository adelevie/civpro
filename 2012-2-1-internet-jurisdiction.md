### Internet Jurisdiction
- reduce min. contacts step, and just judge step 2 of reasonableness
	- suggested by some scholars, but no court does this
- *Zippo*'s test: sliding scale
	- one extreme: sends physical stuff to a user's home address (from a contract)
	- middle:
	- another extreme: a user posts things online
- alternative to Zippo: let's just look at the fairness like we always have
- Calder is important, because many Internet cases are intentional torts

### Schaffer v. Heitzner
- Greyhound in Delaware case
- Pennoyer, service could be served to anyone who steps foot in a forum, you can sue them over anything in Maryland, regardless of their ties to the forum
	- Pure territoriality: attach property to a suit regardless of the ties of that property to the dispute
- Int'l Shoe fairness approach
	- Does this interfere with the purely territorial approach
- Target: jurisdiction based on the attachment of property in the forum state
- situs of property is the location of the paper itself
	- corporate stock presents a problem to this
	- traditional common law: situs of the property of stock is the state where it was incorporated
		- most states abandoned this, in favor of using the location of the paper
			- at the time of Schaffer, DE was the only state not to use this rule
- derivative suit: company.stockholder sues company.officers, :for => violating company.policies
- quasi in rem isn't dead, some limited cases:
	- P can't find D -> can't technically establish in personam jurisdiction
	- Rule 4(n)(2)
_ Burnhav (Supreme Court): preserves TAG jurisdiction (pure Pennoyer territoriality survives)
	- you probably have to be there knowingly and voluntarily
	- you can't lure someone to a state through fraud
	- subpoenaed as a witness could be an exemption
	
#### FRCP 1406

- preserves original date of filing

### Subject Matter Jurisdiciton
- difference between personal:
	- personal (aka territorial jurisdiction) governs whom can be haled before the court of a particular state as a D depending on D's relationship with state. a locational question of can you sue this defendant in this geographical location? Is there pers. juris. over this D?
	- subject matter governs types of cases a court can here
		- ie US district courts can only hear certain categories of cases
		- does the court have jurisdiction over this case?
		- sometimes concerns courts of special topics, ex. tax/bankruptcy courts/etc.
			- not an issue of *which* court, but *can any* court hear the case?

#### Article 3 Constitution
- outlines categories of cases that a US court can ever be given jurisdiction by congress
