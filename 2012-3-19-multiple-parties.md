## Multiple Parties
- See Joinder page

### Toberman v. Copas
- Toberman (P) got into accident with truck driven by Menendez (D, 3PD), and owned by St. Johnsbury Trucking (3PD)
- Menendez went wrong by trying to claim that St. Johnsbury was completely responsible for the accident.
- 3PD can't be derivatively liable if D isn't liable.
- Menendez should have just denied the allegation in his answer to the complaint.

### Temple v. Synthes
- Temple sues Synthes (and not the Dr. Larocca) for a med mal/instrument case
- Synthase wants Larocca in the case
- Why didn't Synthase just join Dr in the first place?
