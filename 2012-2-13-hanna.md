### Hannah v. Plumer
- Case brought into state court, process served according to fed rules, but not according to Mass. rules
- Pure Outcome Determinative Test:
	- yes, the outcome does depend on whether or not service was acceptable
- Byrd Balancing Test:
	- if effect on outcome is speculative, you balance the interest of the state of the fed court applying the state rule against the interest of the fed govt in not applying the state rule
		- Mass govt has interest in giving actual knowledge of service of process to executors of estates
		- Fed govt has interest in having a uniform set of rules
		- Fed govt has interest in creating its own housekeeping rules
		- Fed govt likes substitute notice
			- battle of general purpose vs. specific need
	- Why would Mass. care if service to an executor was personal
- Supreme Court modified the Pure Outcome Determinative Test
- Twin Aims of Erie (Test)
	- discourage forum shopping
	- prevent inequitable administration of law
	- applied here:
		- this isn't a kind of rule someone would base his forum shopping on
		- in 99.9% of cases, the result is going to be the same between federal + state court
	- usually, a difference in rule that's enough to encourage forum shopping, is also an inequitable rules
		- sometimes there are rules that wont encourage forum shopping, but they still promote inequity
	- IF P WOULDN'T SHOP BASED ON THE RULE DIFFERENCE, LET THE FED COURT APPLY THE RULE
- Nikolai: was it outcome determinative when the suit was brought (instead of when the issue was raised)
- Hannah Presumption
	- [FRCP 2072(b)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2072)
	- if a fed rule of procedure makes it through that process in the normal way, it is presumptively procedural enough/ok
	- so long as a federal rule is rationally classifiable as procedural or substantive, it is ok and doesn't violate 2072(b). Thus far every single fed rule has been deemed ok under 2072(b)
	- when there is a clear conflict between a state rule and a fed rule of civ pro, fed rule wins
		- so how do we determine if there's conflict?
		- so when do we still do Erie analysis?
			- when there is no conflict between state and fed rules...here the fed court just decides whether or not to apply the state law

- A US district court judge sitting in diversity is supposed to determine state law as determined by the supreme court of that state. Absent a supreme court decision, they have to determine what that court would have said.
	- Skinner decided to put of the specific question about the Mass. law (GV 52-55)
		- decided to wait to see if the rule even mattered. IF it did matter, they could go through "Certification" and ask the Mass. Supreme court what the law is, rather than guess.

- in the absence of a controlling decision by the highest court of the state, a fed court sitting in diversity must other sources to try and divine how the supreme court resole the issue at hand. the fed court will ordinarily consider decisions by intermediate state courts. bc these decisions aren't binding on the states highest court, they are not binding on the fed court attempting to ascertain state law. other sources:
	- fed precedent, decisions from other states, scholarly works
	- NONE OF THIS IS BINDING ONTO THE STATE
	
### Three civ pro styles
- technical, confining
- trans-subsitive <---- our system for the most part. no special rules for every single type of case
- importance of pleadings
	- do they just get the ball rolling or should the case mostly hinge on them?
	- FRCP => reduce the pleadings
	- Twombley and Iqbal: raised the price of the ticket into the game

### The complaint
- FRCP Rule 7
- http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_7
- FRCP Rule 8(a)
- http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_8
- http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_84
- 12(b)(6)
	- motion for summary j
- 12(c) - motion for j on the pleadings (after D has filed answer)

### Conley
- Conflict between black RR workers and their union
- Union contended the workers did not state a claim which entitled them to relief
- workers sue their union
- after union received complaint, they moved to dismiss under 12(b)(6) - failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted
	- two main ways a complaint can fail to state such a claim:	
		- p. 293-294
	- union claims RLA only governs conduct in reaching the agreement, not after the agreement
		- court says RLA imposes a continuing duty, so case stands thus far
	- union claims P failed to make specific allegations
		- court dismisses this, asserting the only point of the complaint is to provide notice
