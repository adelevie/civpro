## Introduction

### Terms
- Rules:
	- Judicial Conference - like the federal agency for the courts
	- 1938: Supreme Court given authority to make its own rules
		- delegated to Advisory Committee of Judicial Conference
		- Supreme Court has authority to adopt rules, but it can also dissent
		- Congress can say no; rarely happens
- Procedure:
	- the rules regulating the steps in a judicial proceeding
	- the mode by which a legal right is enforced, or the way a legal duty is imposed, distinguished from the substantive law that creates that right or duty in the first place (broader notion)
- Civil:
	- contrast with criminal
	- who brings the lawsuit?
		- brought by a *private entity to enforce *private rights
		- in criminal, it's brought by the government or state on behalf of the people
		- gov't *can bring civil suits though; gov't contracts case example:
			- US v. Lockheed is a civil case
	- remedies/penalties
		- civil: can never be jail time; usually money, maybe injunctive; money almost always goes to plaintiff
		- criminal: jail or money (goes to state)
	- burden of proof
		- civil: preponderance of evidence (ex. 50.0001%)
		- criminal: beyond reasonable doubt (ex. 99.9%)
	- constitutional provisions
		- civil: only right to due process
		- criminal: more requirements/rights (ex. disclosure)
- Federal
	- Which court's procedures are we studying? Federal District Courts
	- Litigation; Did something go wrong in the Federal District Court?
	- District Courts feed into Circuit Courts (ex. DC, 9th)
		- Circuits divided into districts (districts are never more than one state)
			- District of Vermont
			- Multiple districts of New York
				- Both of these feed into the same circuit court

### Universal questions
- How do you tell someone you are suing them? (Notice)
- What are you suing them for? (Service of process)
- Where can you sue? (Personal jurisdiction; Venue)
- How many claims can you bring? (Joinder; Joinder of Party)
	- sue two people at the same time, etc.
- How do you get the facts?
	- adversarial
		- discovery: get information from the other side
	- accusatorial (?)
- Dispute resolution
	- what are the standards to say that a case should be dismissed before hearing the facts? (Summary judgment)
- When are you allowed to bring a claim even though you lost it in another tribunal/venue? (Claim preclusion)
	- issue preclusion is a variant
- What is the judge's role?
	- passive? active? neutral?
- US rules provide room for judicial management of legislation


### Neutral and Passive Decision Maker 
- refrain from judgement until conclusion of contest
- refrain from gathering evidence and settling the case
- Reasons:
	- passivity prevents decision maker from committing to one version of the facts
	- exudes trustworthiness  
- Goals:
	- find truth
	- resolve the dispute
- American adversarial system
	- skewed more to resolving dispute than finding truth
	- favors use of jury:
		- many jurors => less chance of bias than one judge
		- jury selection can weed out biased people
		- lay people are usually free of dispositions that judges have

### Party Presentation of Evidence
- Parties, not judges, are responsible for all evidence
	- insulates judge from involvement in the contest
- focuses decision on needs of litigants
- relies on advocates who have forensic skills

### Structured Forensic Procedure
- Pretrial/posttrial periods; trial (evidence), counsel behavior (ethics)
	- confrontation yields evidence to make decision on 
	- ensure fairness by giving both sides equal opportunity to present case
- Evidence rules prohibit unreliable and prejudicial evidence
	- strictly enforced by judge
- Ethics prohibit bad things like harassment and require good things like zeal from undivided loyalty

### American Legal Exceptionalism (Kagan)
- American legal system is distinctive
	- more complex legal rules
	- more formal, adversarial procedures for legal and scientific disputes
	- more costly legal contestation
	- stronger legal sanctions
	- more judicial review of administrative decisions and processes
	- more political controversy about legal rules
	- more politically fragmented decision-making systems
	- more legal uncertainty/instability

### Adversarial Legalism
- formal legal contestation >> competing interests invoke legal rights
- litigant activism >> search for controlling legal arguments and gathering of evidence is controlled by activists through their lawyers, and not through judges.
- associated with fragmented authority and weak hierarchy
	- Costly and uncertain
- Four "ideal types":

		<td>Negotiation/mediation</td>
		<td>Adversarial legalism</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br />

#### Negotiation/mediation
- example: "official" third party encourages parties to settle, but doesn't impost a settlement based on law

#### Bureaucratic legalism
- uniform implementation
- centrally-devised rules
- examples: tax-collecting agencies, German and French courts where judges also dominate evidence-gathering

#### Adversarial legalism
- American system
- Tort law:
	- not uniform; juries => uncertainty
	- more political
- Admin law:
	- rules on public notice and comment, ex parte, evidentiary and scientific standards

### The Roots of Adversarial Legalism
- US is has a strong society and a weak state
- Adversarial legalism resolved tension between expectation of gov't protection and mistrust of central authority
- US is most politically and socially responsive court system in the world

## Notice

### 5th Amendment

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

### Greene v. Lindsey - "known reasonable alternatives"

- Facts: Process servers placed notice of forcible entry/detainer on a tenant's door. Tenant never showed up to trial and judgment was defaulted. Tenant appealed claiming he never had a right to due process. Appeal court reversed in favor of tenants.

	- Who is the first party to go court?
		- Housing Authority in state court in Kentucky against tenants of a housing project
	- What kind of relief were they seeking?
		- Evict tenants via forcible entry and detainer action
		- Writ of possession
	- Who won the first proceedings?
		- Plaintiff (housing authority); defendants didn't show up (didn't find out about proceeding), lost by default
	- What did the losing party do after they lost?
		- appealed to District Court of Kentucky (Federal court)
	- Why didn't they appeal in Kentucky court system?
		- Their time to appeal in state court had elapsed, but Section 1983 allows this kind of suit
		- They could have brought this suit in state court
		- Federal question jurisdiction: the case turns on an issue of federal law (14th Amendment)
		- Who were the plaintiffs in federal court?
			- the evicted tenants in a *class action
				- group who are highly representative of a broad group of people
					- outcome applies to all members of the class
				- seeking injunctive relief; a court ordered reformation of how these actions are processed
		- Holding in federal court: Affirmed, for tenants, after cross motions for summary judgment.
		- Fair Notice
		- Fair Hearing
		- What rules are processed by the case?
			- 14th Amendment
			- Mullane
		- what rules does the case create?
- Issue: *When is the posting of a notice on the door of a house an acceptable substitute for personal service under the 14th Amendment?
- Rule: It is, so long as it is reasonable and sufficient effort has been placed to make personal service first. A state can't rely on a method it knows to be ineffective.
- HW: What is the holding/rule of the case?

#### Alternative hypo 1

Plaintiff is renter in a standalone house in high rent subdivision. No record of kids ripping down signs. Sheriff posts notice, freak gust of wind blows it down. P claims inadequate notice.

"Sometimes posting is a marvelous way to serve notice."

Posting by notice isn't always unconstitutional, but, when *is it unconstitutional?

#### Alternative hypo 2

Sheriff goes to building. Lonely Bob lives by himself, hasn't paid rent. 

Lonely Bob isn't home when Sheriff posts notice. Kid rips down notice. Sheriff sends mail followup. Lonely Bob stopped checking mail.

Is this kosher?

More facts: Sheriff notices that Lonely Bob's notice has been thrown around as a paper plane and that his mailbox is stuffed.

Does this info change the constitutionality?
