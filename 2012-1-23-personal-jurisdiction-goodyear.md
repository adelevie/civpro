### World Wide Volkswagen
- p. 123: state lines aren't irrelevant
 - no more pure territoriality, but border lines still matter

### International Shoe
- pro-plaintiff result: *made it easier for plaintiffs to sure defendants*
	- plaintiffs could look around see anywhere there was jurisdiction based on contacts.
	- personal jurisdiction is broader than people thought it was
- Justice Black is worried that a curtailing of the Pennoyer test could limit areas where you can get jurisdiction

### Pennoyer
- you can sue someone in a state they were served, no matter how unfair it is to sue them there.
- are you in the borders? Then state can assert personal jurisdiction.

## General versus Specific Jurisdiction
- hypo: if Int'l Shoe has an equally significant biz relationship with all 50 states, can you sue in Florida on a lark?
	- No. The dispute did not *arise out of* the defendant's contacts with the state.

### Goodyear v. Brown
- 10s of 1000s of Goodyear Luxembourg sold in North Carolina, but still a small overall percentage
- Specific jurisdiction: the claim arises out of the contact
- General jurisdiction: the claim does not arise out of the defendant's contact within the state
- P wanted to assert general jurisdiction.
	- they wouldn't try for specific jurisdiction, because the accident didn't happen in North Carolina.
- If D's contacts with state are *substantial and continuous* and dispute arose out of those contacts, there almost always be specific jurisdiction.
- If corporation has committed an *occasional and solitary* act, then there might be specific jurisdiction.
- General jurisdiction (from Int'l Shoe): (p. 113) defendant is so embedded in this state
	- dispute-blind jurisdiction
- Is Goodyear Luxembourg's involvement so substantial that you can sue for anything even if it's not related to the dispute?
	- Held: NO! Not even close...
- Having headquarters in a state means you can sue the corporation in that state over anything.
	- must be clearly regarded as *the* home of the corporation
- Some scholars interpret this case as holding that Incorporation or Headquarters is necessary to assert general jurisdiction
- merely putting goods into the stream of commerce is not enough for general jurisdiction

### Helicopteros
- South American company sent CEO to Texas, trained personnel in Texas, etc etc
- not enough for general jurisdiction

### Chart

- You can always sue a corporation over anything in a state that they're incorporated.

## *Exam Hypo*
- During exams, when you come into a fork in the road, take it.
- G&V p. 5 #4
- Anne Anderson protests W.R. Grace outside their NY HQ.
- She is injured by company security guards.
- She dues Grace in Mass. state court.
- Does Mass. have personal jurisdiction over Grace?

### Specific jurisdiction
- cases where the case undisputedly arose out of the defendant's contact in that state.

### McGee p. 115
- Texas Co. sold a policy to a single customer (McGee) in CA.
- policy-holder dies, dispute with daughter (beneficiary) over benefits
- Can daughter establish specific jurisdiction?
	- arose out of the company's one contact in CA
	- Held: Yes.

### Hanson v. Denckla p. 116
- Trust company had only one contact with Florida
- Held: no personal jurisdiction
- Difference between *McGee*
	- McGee Company *purposefully availed* of laws of CA
	- Here, trust company did not personally avail itself of laws in Florida
		- the only reason this involved Florida, is that P moved there

### Kulko p. 116 - 117
- Father let daughters live with mother in CA.
	- he has nothing to do with CA except that his daughter lives there with his separated wife
- Mother sues father in CA
	- Supreme Court says CA can't assert jurisdiction
- Is this purposeful availment?

### Long-arm statutes
- grabs defendants from other states
- p. 116 Illinois long arm statute
- Courts can only assert jurisdiction over classes chosen by the legislature

#### Two step states
- long arm statute has specific provisions where it applies
- statutory analysis, then constitutional analysis
	- first does statute permit jurisdiction?
	- If so, is assertion of jurisdiction constitutional?

#### One step states
- state courts have jurisdiction over out of state defendant to the limit of due process
	- maximum range of defendants
