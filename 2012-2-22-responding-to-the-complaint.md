## Rule 15: Amending the Complaint
- FRCP provides the most liberal amendment
- You want to allow amendments so the parties can adjust as they learn more things,and to correct technical mistakes

### Questions
1. When can a P amend a complaint w/o court permission or the permission of his opponent? (Amendment/pleading as a matter of course).
	- Q: Are you under 15(a)(1)(a) or 15(a)(1)(b)?
		- A: 15(a)(1)(b): you can amend a complaint within 21 days after you have received an answer or a rule 12 pre-answer motions, with no one's permission.
2. When can a D amend an answer as a matter of course (w/o court's or opponent's permission)
	- Q: Are you under 15(a)(1)(a) or 15(a)(1)(b)?
		- A: 15(a)(1)(a): 21 days after P's complaint.

### Three things
- Distinguish between these:
	1. amendment as a matter of course
	2. when you cannot amend as a matter of course (you need permission)
		- Rule 15(a)(2): the court should freely give leave when justice so requires
	3. relation back
		- if something *relates back* to the original complaint, you can make the amendment
		- Rule 15(c)

### Amending late
- Not good, since D only has one pass at a lot of parts of discovery (ex. medical examinations)
- Standard of Court of Appeals overturning district judge on permitting amendments is *abuse of discretion* (a hard standard).

### Relation Back
- you can change the rule or the legal theory and get relation back
- transactional test (will be discussed later)

#### Barcume v. City of Flynt
- P amends Compl against police department
	- Original complaint: discrimination in hiring and promotion under the Elliot Larson Civil Rights Act
		- demands specific remedy: inclusion in already-existing affirmative action plan
- could they amend their complaint as a matter of course: no, way past that. they need permission.
	- judge gives permission, now it becomes a statute of limitations problem
- Rule:

## The Answer

### Combine Rule 8, 7, and 12. A D might respond with:
- things that he can only do in the answer
	- Rule 8(b)-(c):
		- Deny factual allegations, plead insufficient knowledge, etc, etc
		- Assert affirmative defenses
		- Counterclaim
- things that can be done in an answer or in a pre-answer motion
	- Rule 12(b) objections
- things that can only be done in a pre-answer motion
	- Rule 12(c)-(f)
	
### Affirmative defenses
- Rule 8(c)
	- an assertion that all statements of facts are true, and even if the law would normally allow P to win, there are *other facts* that get D off the hook
- Examples:
	- assumption of risk
		- I violated a duty etc etc, but you assumed risk
	- fraud in contract

#### Minimal implications for defense
- if they fail to include an affirmative defense, they can always amend
	- subject to court's approval so far as justice requires (easy)
	- only exception is if amendment seriously prejudiced P

#### Well pleaded complaint
- a well pleaded complaint does not include the negation of affirmative defenses

#### Burden of Pleading

#### Gomez v. Toledo
- ยง 1983 action
	- Defense(s):
		- Good Faith defense: there is an understanding that state actor was acting in good faith.
- Issue: was bad faith an affirmative defense?
	- OR
- Was lack of good faith something that P needed to bring up?
- Dismissal overturned, then remanded back down the chain.

### Rules 12(g)-(h)
- if you file a rule 12 motion before the answer, you need to include all your insufficiency etc arguments
- if you don't file a rule 12 motion before an answer, you must include these in the answer, or an amendment to the answer within 21 days

### SAMPLE EXAM
- p. 361
- motion to dismiss for improper venue?
	- Rule 12(g) says no.
		- You only have one shot a pre-answer 12 b motion
	- could he do it in the answer? (assuming he did omit it from a pre-answer motion)
		- No. Rule 12(h)(1)(B)(ii). He was toast the moment he omitted in a motion described by 12(g)(2)
	- dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction?
		- Rule 12(h)(3): Lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

#### Sample answer
- Here's the plain language
- Here's the policy, article III, so you should be able to ______


#### Lack of subject matter jurisdiction
- Un-waivable, Article III of the Constitution
