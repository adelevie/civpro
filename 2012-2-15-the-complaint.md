12 C dismissal after defense

## TwIqbal

### Twombly
- ILECS, CLECS, Collusion
- pleading: the tollbooth to the road of discovery
- Conley set a fairly low standard for getting through this tollbooth to discovery
	- just enough facts to give notice
	- Twombly requires not just facts to provide notice, but to set forth a plausible claim
	- usually not enough facts would lead to dismissal without prejudice
	- Twiqbal cases like to give dismissal *with prejudice*. This is significant.
