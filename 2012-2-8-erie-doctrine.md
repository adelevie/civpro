### Removal
- can be based on either diversity jurisdiction 1332 or federal question 1331
- what if Mottley's brought case to KY state court?
- well-pleaded complaint rule prevents a case from *ever* being in federal court (1441)

- mandatory counterclaim
	- if P gets to court first, he can trap case in Fed. court

#### Removal based on diversity jurisdiction
- file a suit in someone's home state, they cannot remove it - 1441(b)(2)

#### 1446(c)(2)
- A notice of removal of a criminal prosecution shall include all grounds for such removal. A failure to state grounds which exist at the time of the filing of the notice shall constitute a waiver of such grounds, and a second notice may be filed only on grounds not existing at the time of the original notice. For good cause shown, the United States district court may grant relief from the limitations of this paragraph.

#### Erie
- p. 870
- FRCP 1652
	- "The laws of the several states"
		- Swift case reads this to include different things:
			- no recognition of state's common law, only statutes and constitutions
		-  P. 875: The fallacy underlying the rule declared in Swift is made clear by Holmes. the doctrine rests upon the assumption that there is a "transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute."
- Made "Federal Common Law" legally irrelevant
- p.874: unfairness, according to Brandeis, since non-citizen gets to pick venue and thereby pick which jurisdiction will favor him
	- doesn't like vertical forum shopping for *substantive law*
- conflict of laws:
	- the law of where the thing happened, will operate, no matter what state the court is in
		- ex. NY can rule with PA law
- still did not kill vertical forum shopping

##### Klaxon
- a NY Fed court sitting in diversity has to pretend it's a NY state court, not just in terms of substantive law, but also in its choice of law.
