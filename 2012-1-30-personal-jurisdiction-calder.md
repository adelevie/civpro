### World Wide Volkswagen
- 4 defendants
	- mfr: vw germany
	- importer: vw america
	- distributor: ww volkswagen (tri state area)
	- Seaway - retail car dealer
		- ^ both of these challenge jurisdiction
		- inc'd in NY with HQ also there
- products liability case
- A car Seaway sold in NY got into a crash in OK
- The dispute *did* arise directly out of the crash => specific jurisdiction
	- product liability dispute
		- car was read-ended; exploded
- Two-step state => you need to find something in the statute that allows this suit
	- long arm statute:
	- you can be subject to jurisdiction by causing tortious in this state by an act or omission outside the state if you regular do business or derive substantial revenue from goods or services rendered in the state (full p. 119)
- US Supreme Court holds: no personal jurisdiction, because every state a right to its own sovereignty
- Test: you are subject personal jurisdiction in a state where you can *reasonably anticipate being haled into court*
	- circular? not particularly helpful
- broader personal jurisdiction costs raise insurance costs
- Test: purposeful availment?
	- From Hanson v. Denckla
- Test: contacts, ties, or relations?
- Good test: *Seek to Serve*
- *General rule: if the vehicle gets to another state by the action of the purchaser, there won't be personal jurisdiction for the dealer.*
	- "independent decisions/actions of the consumer"
- Dissent:
	- dealer can sell cars because cars have access to a national network of roads => purposeful availment
		- here, the dissent embraces the purposeful availment argument, just looks at the concept of car sales with a different vision
- this is not a stream of commerce case
	- a stream of commerce analysis ends when the final sale has been made.
- White's considerations on p. 122 get pulled out by Asahi
- p. 124: White: The forum state does not exceed its powers under the Due Process Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum state.

#### Exam Hypo
- What if instead of an Audi, it was an RV
	- If White sticks to his own text, then there is jurisdiction
	
### Asahi
- CA motorcycle rider, Zirker, injured in CA motorcycle accident
	- sued mfr of Taiwanese tire tube company, Cheng Shin
	- Taiwanese company sued valve manufacturer, Asahi
	- Zirker settles, case is indemnification between Cheng Shin and Asahi (japanese valve mfr)
		- is Asahi subj. to jurisd. in CA?
		- no adverts, no direct sales; but many valve assemblies were installed in tires that ended up in CA
	- indemnification dispute
- Holdings:
	- you are subj. to jurisdiction in a state if you put a product into the stream of commerce in that state => 4 justices
	- O'Connor: purposeful availment is the test
		- no extra attention targeted at CA => no jurisdiction
	- *stream of commerce+* test


### Analysis of personal jurisdiction (2 steps)
- 1) does D have min. contacts w/ the state? If no; break; else:
- 2) is assertion of jurisdiction *reasonable and fair*
- Brennan's Reasonableness factors from Burger King
	1. burden of defendant
		- distance, foreign legal systems, size of company, econ. fairness
	2. forum state's interest
		- state has interest in safe products, enforced contracts
	3. P's interest in convenient and effective relief
		- econ. fairness, general convenience
	4. interstate judicial system's interest in most efficient resolution of controversies
		- choice of court, choice of law; joinder is more efficient
	5. shared interests of several states in furthering substantive social policies
		- derives from Kulko (*man and woman married in NY, separate, man allows daughter to go to CA to live with mother, mother sues in CA, no CA juris bc he didn't pers. avail himself of CA*)
		- eg, best interest of child (what kind of incentive would that provide to parents)
		- think of incentives made by particular ruling and determine if we want the substantive effects of the ruling
		- interests of other nations and US foreign policy establishment
			- can't subject foreign companies willy nilly to US jurisdiction

### Nicostra v. McIntyre
- NJ man lost fingers in metal shearing machine sold by British Co., McIntyre
- Chain of distribution: McIntyre set up a US distribution company, McIntyre US
- McIntyre UK set up a company to do business in the US
	- attended conferences in other US states (not NJ)
	- sold a few machines in NJ, we don't know what % of the volume this is
	- has a US Patent
- *plurality* uses stream of commerce+ test
	- Kennedy embraces state sovereignty language (p. 27 - supp.)
	- no min contacts, fail step one, we're done
- *dissent*: (Ginsburg)
	- once you avail yourself of the US market as a whole, any state can assert personal jurisdiction
- *Breyer* (plus Alito) concurring: rejects notion of automatic nationwide distribution system rule
	- saying this is not a stream of commerce case. a stream is a predictable path. one solitary machine does not imply a stream.
	- concern about the Appalachian potter
	- Grossman's answer: you don't need to reject the dissent's stream of commerce test. you could let the flexibility of the fairness test to address the problem that dominates his analysis.

### Calder v. Jones
- Facts:
	- Florida-based reporters for the Enquirer (D) served notice for libel suit in CA, which is where the subjects of their story (P) were located.
- Holding: reporters purposefully targeted CA, so CA can assert personal jurisdiction
	- exception to the purposeful availment test
		- *Nicostra* makes exceptions for intentional torts, like this case
		- editor lacks direct econ. stake over CA; lacks control
			- Hanson v. Denckla analysis would hold no jurisdiction
	- this isn't un-targeted negligence, this is a targeted tort
		- requires intent to do something wrong
		- is it negligence, or something more?
			- if it's something more and intentional => probably jurisdiction
			- if it's something more and unintentional but reckless => maybe jurisdiction (subject to the fairness test)

#### *Effects test*: knowingly cause harm in the state by an act performed elsewhere
- still a two step process (requires fairness for example)
- an alternative to step 1 of the purposeful availment test
	- an important basis for Internet jurisdiction

### Contacts and Contracts

### Clauses
- choice of law
	- states apply other states' laws fairly often
		- conflicts of laws
- forum selection
	- where the suit can be
	- can serve as consent to jurisdiction in that forum
- arbitration
	- no more Int'l Shoe Analysis because these clauses typically handle dispute over jurisdiction
	- law overwhelmingly supports these

### Burger King v. Rudzewicz
- importance contractual language
- no forum selection clause
- there is a choice of law clause
	- *is this relevant to jurisdictional analysis?*
- Facts:
	- franchisee contract in BK required payments be made to its HQ in Miami
	- Michigan-based franchisees didn't make payments to BK
	- BK sues for injunctive relief to make them cease operations
	- BK sued in FL
	- Franchisees made inter alia appearance claiming FL court could not assert personal jurisdiction because the dispute did not arise out of FL
	- FL District Court denied motions and awarded damages to BK
	- Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the circumstances left franchisees bereft of reasonable notice and financially unprepared for litigation in FL
- Supreme Court: Majority, Brennan (5 reasonableness factors)
	- it would offend fundamental fairness
	- Due process clause: not subject to judgment from areas where you lack meaningful *contacts, ties, or relations*.
	- Issue: did franchisee establish min. contacts in FL?
		- test from WW VW: reasonably anticipate being haled to court
	- Held: FL can assert personal jurisdiction
		- Rudzewicz *deliberately reached out* to a FL corp.
			- contract emphasized BK's FL HQ
			- Birmingham office was powerless to resolve certain disputes
		- sometimes inconvenience can be used to make a constitutional arg., but not here
		- Facts of each case must weighed, this is not a talismanic rule
- Dissent (Stevens, with White)
	- appellee only did business in Mich., boilerplate contract is a bit much to establish personal jurisdiction
- Notes + Questions
