### Contacts and Contracts

### Burger King v. Rudzewicz
- Facts:
	- franchisee contract in BK required payments be made to its HQ in Miami
	- Michigan-based franchisees didn't make payments to BK
	- BK sues for injunctive relief to make them cease operations
	- BK sued in FL
	- Franchisees made inter alia appearance claiming FL court could not assert personal jurisdiction because the dispute did not arise out of FL
	- FL District Court denied motions and awarded damages to BK
	- Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the circumstances left franchisees bereft of reasonable notice and financially unprepared for litigation in FL
- Supreme Court: Majority, Brennan
	- it would offend fundamental fairness
	- Due process clause: not subject to judgment from areas where you lack meaningful *contacts, ties, or relations*.
	- Issue: did franchisee establish min. contacts in FL?
		- test from WW VW: reasonably anticipate being haled to court
	- Held: FL can assert personal jurisdiction
		- Rudzewicz *deliberately reached out* to a FL corp.
			- contract emphasized BK's FL HQ
			- Birmingham office was powerless to resolve certain disputes
		- sometimes inconvenience can be used to make a constitutional arg., but not here
		- Facts of each case must weighed, this is not a talismanic rule
- Dissent (Stevens, with White)
	- appellee only did business in Mich., boilerplate contract is a bit much to establish personal jurisdiction
