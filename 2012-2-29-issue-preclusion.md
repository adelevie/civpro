## Issue Preclusion

### Rule 27 - General Rule
- p. 1161
- When an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment...

### Rule 28 - Exceptions
- implicit in these, is that there is no issue preclusion based on suit1 unless the party you are trying to preclude had a full and fair opportunity in suit1 
- (2): no preclusion if issue is of law and two actions are un-similar
- Rule § 27
	- valid and final judgment
	- actually litigated (ex. not simple admissions)
	- actually determined (basis for verdict/decision must be clear and not vague)
	- essential to the judgment (the decision-maker must have given the issue the true attention it deserves [ie, this wont happen if the decision didn't quite swing on this determination]).

### Rule 29 - use by 3rd parties

### Differences between Claim preclusion
- coverage:
	- there is a big difference between an issue and a claim
	- the claim can include matters that were never even mentioned in suit1
	- for issues, the issue must be the same in suit1 and suit2 and must have been litigated in suit1
- the effect:
	- if a court finds claim preclusion, it must outright dismiss the second action
	- issue preclusion simply compels the 2nd court to make the same finding on that issue as made by the 1st court
- policy goals
	- both want efficiency and judicial economy
		- you don't want people splitting claims
		- you don't want people re-litigating issues
	- issue preclusion strives to prevent inconsistent judgments
		- always in issue preclusion, only sometimes in claim preclusion

### IRS v. Sunnen
- Issues have to be really, really, really identical for preclusion
- Intervening change in law is an important exception in issue preclusion
- § 28(2)(b)

### Exceptions 
- Change in law is not an exception to Claim Preclusion (but not issue preclusion)
- § 28(4) (p.1162)
	- change in burden between the two cases (ex. difference between criminal [99%] and civil [50%])
- § 28(3): different quality or extensiveness of procedures
- § 28(5)(b): unforeseeable of second suit

## Non-mutual Issue Preclusion
- Can X (who was not in suit1), use issue preclusion in suit2?
	- strict mutuality rule says no.
		- largely abandoned in US

### Offensive v. Defensive
- look at posture of suit2

### Mutuality
- in suit2, p2 and D should have the same relationship as suit1
	- D shouldn't be able to get hurt by suit1 (since p2 and can't get hurt by suit1) (due process)
- Analyze by unfairness and inefficiency

### Disadvantages of mutuality
- inefficient: issues get litigated twice
- potentially inconsistent
- not nec. unfair to D to impose issue preclusion on him

## Issue Preclusion in a Federal System

### Restatement
- Exceptions to issue preclusion, p 1161, § 28
- Issue Preclusion in subsequent Litigation w others, p. 1162, § 29
	- Yes, you can have non-mutual issue preclusion

- When mutuality is abandoned, not all cases are treated the same.
	- Params: 
		- posture of suit1
		- posture of suit2

### Posture Types
1. B sues A, X sues A (weakest case for issue preclusion)
2. A sues B, X sues A
3. B sues A, A sues X
4. A sues B, A sues X (strongest case for issue preclusion)

### Blondertung
- Supreme Court abandoned mutuality (in the strongest posture)
- suit1
	- Inventor v. X (for violating his patent)
	- X wins (ex. b/c the patent is invalid)
- suit2
	- Inventor v. Z
	- Z wants issue preclusion, as there had already been a court that determined the issue of the valdity of the patent
- Holding: OK, we'll let you do issue preclusion. Inventor can't get multiple bites at the apple.
-posture:
	- A sues B, A sues X (strongest case for issue preclusion)

### Parklane (p. 1174)
- Issue was already decided in SEC case
- D had every incentive to fully defended themselves the first time (since it was the SEC suing them)
	- foreseeability didn't even matter because suit1 was already filed

### § 29(3)
- court must consider if the party easily could have joined in the earlier action, a trial judge should not allow for offensive collateral estoppel (p. 1177)

### § 29(2)
- Are there reasonable procedural opportunities in suit2 that weren't i suit2 that justify another chance to litigate the issue?
	- EX: a jury in suit2, whereas they couldn't have had one in suit1 (issue related to lack of right to jury in equitable suits) -- Parklane killed this.
	- These are still valid:
		- greater chances for discovery in suit2
