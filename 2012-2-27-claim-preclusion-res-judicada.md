## Claim Preclusion

### Terms
- claim preclusion = res judicada
- issue preclusion= collateral estoppel

- Claim preclusion arises when there is a second lawsuit, of the same party, and of the same claim
	- parties in suit 1 are the same in suit 2
		- suit1.parties == suit2.parties
- Can include things not brought into the complaint, when there is a rule requiring incluion to prevent preclusion
- Prevent's "claim splitting"

### Merger
- You can't bring new claims arising out of the same cause of action
- p. 1159
- Exception to merger
	- if P wins, but can't collect his winnings in Maine, he isn't barred from going to CA to ask that court to recognize the case in Maine and let him seize property

### Car Carriers v. Ford
- 1982 ruling for Ford as P didn't suffer the type of harm required by the Sherman anti-trust act
- Second suit in 1983, new set of claims including RICO (federal organized crime statute, and a completely separate legal theory)
- Policy that drives preclusion:
	- Serves the interest of defendants by promoting finality
	- repose-ish
- Fails fact-oriented transaction test
- P says court should rely on a "*duties analysis*" not a "*same transaction test*"
	- court rejects this
- You can't beat claim preclusion because you find some fact later
	- forces you to do your homework early
	- evidence must have existed at the time of the claim for this to apply
	- BUT
		- events that occur after the original suit
		
### Exceptions to Claim Preclusion
- p. 1161 Restatement
	- § 26: you shouldn't be punished for splitting you claim in suit #1 if you had no choice
		- ex. jurisdiction of suit #1 might not have allowed you to bring these two arguments together
	- § 26(1)(d): plainly inconsistent with the equitable implementation of a statutory or constitutional scheme
	- § 26(1)(e)

#### Rule 18 Joinder of claims
- put everything in the bucket of suit #1

#### Rule 15 Amendment
- liberal amendment policy

#### Same Transaction Test
- related to *Relation Back*
	- if judge says yes to new claim, but you miss statute of limitations, you can still bring the claim because it relates back
- "If you change the legal theory, you can get relation back, but if you change/add facts, you cannot get relation back."

```

	...if you add a legal theory entitling you to relief under the same factual situation, you get relation back.  You run into problems if you “assert a new claim for relief based on different facts than set forth in the original complaint.”  (pp. 384).  This is not a perfect rule, but it gets you most of the way home. 

	...The real question is whether the defendant was put on notice.

	The rule also doesn’t answer the question whether you get relation back if you amend your complaint to request additional relief under the exact same legal theory (say strict products liability) but based on a completely distinct set of facts (say, a different injury at a different time from a different product).
	
```
#### Hypo
- You get injured form botulized food sold by Heinz
- there's potential negligence theory and strict liability theory, what should you do?
	- include them both in your cause of action

### Use The Restatement
- Do we have a single core of operative fact? (similar to single transaction test)
- § 17 (p. 1158): valid and final requirement
	- valid: correct jurisdiction (validity is so rare, we consider all suits valid for exam)
		- subject matter jurisdiction example:
			- suit1, no on argues subj matter jursidction, losing party realizes court #1 didn't have subject matter j. brought up in suit #2, saying suit #1 was invalid.
		- personal jurisdiction example
			- if objection is waived then you can't raise it later to attack validity of prior suit.
				- risky workaround: lose by default, waive nothing.
	- final: when the case is cooked/ready for appeal
		- an appeal doesn't make things not final.
- "On the merits" (p. 1159, listed as exceptions)
	- you only want the preclusive effect when it was a decision on the merits, not a procedural dismissal.
	- § 21 lack of jurisdiction problems etc
	- Bases for dismissal in suit 1 that make it ineligible for dismissal in suit 2:
		- Rule 41(b) Involuntary Dismissal; Effect. If the plaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it. Unless the dismissal order states otherwise, a dismissal under this subdivision (b) and any dismissal not under this rule—except one for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19—operates as an adjudication on the merits.
