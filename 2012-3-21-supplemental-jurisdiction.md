## Jurisdiction
- First look for 1332 (original subject jurisdiction). Only if this is lacking do you look for supplemental jurisdiction

### 1367
 -http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1367
- (A) if the 3rd party claim is related to the first claim, there will be supplemental jurisdiction
	- so closely related that it arises from the *same case or controversy*
- (B) Exceptions:
	- certain assertions aren't allowed if original claim is a diversity case to try to preserve complete diversity of jurisdiction
- (C) Even if it's connected enough per (A) and doesn't fit an exception in (B), we need to deal with (C)
- MISSING: a claim by plaintiff made under Rule 20

### Jones v. Ford
- can there ever be supplemental jurisdiction for a permissive counterclaim (as opposed to a compulsory counterclaim which must be brought into the suit)?
	- courts used to assume (core of operative fact) == (same transaction or occurrence)

### Owing Equipment v. Kroger

#### 1376(b)
- imperfect but perceivable attempt to turn the principles from Own into statute form
	
### Tests Glossary
- Same case or controversy
	- easier to meet than "same transaction or occurrence" test. 
- Core of operative fact (deadish)
- Same transaction or occurrence
	- uses logical relationship test
		- is it closely related enough that it is fair and efficient to hear at the same time?
